# Sales Forecasting & On-Demand Predictions 📊

This is a **Streamlit** application designed for forecasting sales, analyzing product demand, visualizing data, and retraining predictive models. The app provides an intuitive interface for business users to make data-driven decisions using machine learning models.

## Features

### 1. **Forecasting Sales**
- Upload marketing budget data in CSV format.
- View data previews and date ranges.
- Generate sales forecasts with visualizations and metrics:
  - Average daily sales
  - Total sales
  - Peak sales

### 2. **Demand Product Analysis**
- Analyze demand for specific product categories.
- Select a product and start date to generate forecasts.
- Visualize predicted demand, average daily demand, total demand, and peak demand.

### 3. **Data Visualization Dashboards**
- Explore general graphs or conduct specified analyses:
  - General Graphs:
    - Bar plots, line plots, pie charts, box plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
  - Specified Analyses:
    - Top 20 best-selling products
    - Order size and value analysis
    - Seasonal revenue patterns by year
    - General seasonal patterns

### 4. **Retraining Models**
- Upload new data and marketing data files.
- Automatically handle existing data versions and merge new data.
- Preprocess and engineer features for time series forecasting.
- Retrain models for sales and demand forecasting.
